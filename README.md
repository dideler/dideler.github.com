My personal website.

- Install dependencies with `bundle install`
- Update Jekyll with `bundle update`
- Preview site with `rake site:preview`
- Create a post with `rake post:new[title]`

If a post doesn't have it's own cover image, it uses the site's cover image.

Built on top of the [Thinny Jekyll theme](https://github.com/camporez/Thinny),
[v2.1](http://camporez.com/blog/hello-cosette/).

To grab any updates to Thinny, I suggest cherry-picking them.
