The [ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](http://icpc.baylor.edu/)
is one of the oldest, largest, and most prestigious coding contests in the world.
Teams of three are given a single computer, 8-11 problems, and 5 hours to solve
as many problems as quickly as they can.

<!-- more -->

The contest consists of three stages:

1. Local contests -- compete against others at your university (optional)
2. Regional contests -- compete against teams from other universities in your
   geographical region
3. World finals -- compete against the best teams from all over the world

Brock University's geographical location places us in the
East Central North America Regional Programming Contest
([ECNA RPC](http://acm.ashland.edu/)).

This is my history of competitive coding.

#### Fall 2008: The Beginning

I was in [COSC 2P03](http://www.brocku.ca/registrar/guides/course_details.php?code=COSC%202P03),
[Wolfgang Haas](https://plus.google.com/117467389878346060466/about) was the instructor.
He competed in ICPC 2004 and his team placed 11th regionally (see image on the right).
He strongly encouraged his class to compete.
A coding contest sounded like challenging fun, plus I can be very competitive.

Our student coaches asked everyone who was interested to write down what
relevant experience they had. I wrote that I competed in a high school
science fair and math competition and performed well in both.
That was enough to get me on a team!


#### Fall 2008: McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario

My team performed poorly at the contest. I probably learned the most from this
contest. Such a terrible performance really makes you analyze what went wrong
and brings you back down to earth.

I also organized a contest for individual tryouts this year, which we usually
don't do.

#### Fall 2012: University of Windsor, Windsor, Ontario

With the help of another student, I organized tryouts again this year. Although
I was able to compete, I wanted to sit out and give someone else the
opportunity. Instead I did a little bit of coaching and signed up as a reserve
just in case. I also met Wesley from [QuestToSolve](http://www.questtosolve.com/),
he was coaching for UofT.

### Other Contests
I've also competed in competitive team-based hackathons and in the Facebook
Hacker Cup. They're completely different experiences than the ICPC, so I'd
recommend anyone to try different programming contests and find the one you like
best.

### Conclusion
I consider myself an above average programmer, but I've learned that I'm an
average competitive programmer. I simply don't spend enough time practicing.
For the amount of times I've competed, the problems I've solved in my free time
is embarrassingly low.

So, was it worth it? **You bet it was.** I've had the opportunity to travel
numerous times, meet some amazing people, and witness some of the best
problem solvers in the country (and the world) work their magic right in front
of me. I've also improved my problem solving skills, and my knowledge of
programming languages (especially C++) -- in short, I'm now a
better and quicker programmer.
I also learned a lot about how contest environments work, how much work it takes
to organize your own, and how much work some schools put into preparation.
In short, it's a great oppurtunity for speed learning and gaining some practical
experience.

If I could do it all over again, I would try to make the ICPC a higher priority
at my school. As it stands, we're a school that goes into the
competition with minimal effort and sometimes we get lucky (when we're able to
recruit the rockstars) and sometimes we don't. This year I tried to prepare us
better, but I think our school takes pride in competing with minimal preparation,
and that'll be difficult to change.

So far we've never had a team go to the world finals. Our region is tough,
but I think it's entirely possible. Hopefully I'll be alive to see it happen!

#### Lessons Learned
- Don't bring loads of printed resources, you won't be using the majority of it
- Team chemistry matters
- Practice as a team and individually
- Figure out the strengths and weaknesses of everyone on the team (including
  yourself)
- Have fun!
