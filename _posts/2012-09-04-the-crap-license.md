The [**Community Research and Academic Programming License (CRAPL)**](http://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/),
is an academic-strength open source license by the well-known professor
[Matt Might](https://twitter.com/mattmight).
Its purpose is to encourage academics to share their "proof of concept" code,
regardless of how ugly it is.

Matt sums up the license:

> Most open source licenses (1) require source and modifications to be shared
> with binaries, and (2) absolve authors of legal liability.

> An open source license for academics has additional needs: (1) it should
> require that source and modifications used to validate scientific claims be
> released with those claims; and (2) more importantly, it should absolve
> authors of shame, embarrassment and ridicule for ugly code.

I asked Matt if the CRAPL was also intended for academic assignments. He replied:

> The A in CRAPL does mean Academic in the sense of Scientific.

> But, really, I think the spirit of it applies to any code that you'd
> like to throw out there that might not be "polished."

> Reviewers (or graders in your case) have unrestricted rights to review
> and modify CRAPLed software, as necessary to verify it according to
> some set of criteria.

> So, I'd say if you want to CRAPL your assignments after the submission
> deadline and post them publicly, go for it! :)
