[Software Niagara](http://www.softwareniagara.com/) held its first
hackathon on the weekend of November 10-11, 2012.
We dubbed it the [#secrethackathon](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23secrethackathon&src=typd).

Because it was our first hackathon as an organization, we decided to keep it
small and keep the details hidden from the public.

We used git for source control, github + basecamp + skype + irc for collaboration,
node.js (and a bunch of node packages) + mongodb + openlayers + bootstrap to build the software.

This was a learning experience for many of us. In my case, I had no experience
with server side technologies, but I sure learned a lot. It was a good team
building experience. We all did a great job and had a lot of fun.
