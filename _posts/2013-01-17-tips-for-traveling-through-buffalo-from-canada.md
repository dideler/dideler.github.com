If you live near the Canada--United States border then you should know about
flying out of the US, especially for international flights.
They tend to be much more affordable, but even though you save money, it can be hassle.

I currently live in Southern Ontario and often take a bus to Buffalo Airport.
This post mostly focuses on the border experience when travelling by bus,
your experience may differ if travelling by car. If you're going to travel by bus
and want to save some extra money, buy your ticket online at least a month in
advance.

If you need to enter the US under the Visa Waiver Program, you'll need
to <strike>obtain an I-94W form (the green form)</strike> apply for travel
authorization through [ESTA](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta/) --
do this a few days before traveling, it requires a fee which can be paid by credit card.

Going through customs at the border is the highlight of the trip.  There's
a processing fee of $6 USD (payable by cash or credit) and you'll be
photographed and fingerprinted. Your luggage will be x-rayed and possibly
opened. The whole process can be very time consuming, especially in the
summer. Plan your trip accordingly so you have _at least_ two hours to spare
between your ETA and flight boarding time <sup>[[1]](#f1)</sup>. I suggest
sitting at the front of the bus if you can, you should have an easier time going
through customs.

Here's some questions the border officer might ask you.

- Where do you live?
- Citizen of what country?
- Are you a resident of Canada? (if you have a non-Canadian passport)
- What is the purpose of your visit?
- Where are you going?
- Where are you staying? Address?
- How long will you be staying? / When are you leaving?
- Last time you visited the US?
- What do you do for a living?
- Where do you go to school? / Where did you graduate from?
- Boarding pass or itinerary?

If you're flying with JetBlue, consider a seat at the rear of the plane. People
at the rear board first (besides people who need special assistance) and it's
a safer section according to crash statistics. Of course, it'll take longer to
get off the plane, so keep that in mind if you have any tight connecting
flights.
