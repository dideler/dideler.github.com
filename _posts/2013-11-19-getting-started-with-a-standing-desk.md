Standing (or stand-up) desks have been around for centuries and now they're
trendy in tech. I gave them go -- here's what I learned.

### Why switch?

<!-- more -->
Health benefits. Mainly posture related.
[4 out of 5 common posture problems share sitting as a possible cause][posture]. <sup>[[1]](#f1)</sup>
Since I've started using a standing desk, I've gotten compliments about my
(supposedly) improved posture.

Other purported benefits include [burning about 30,000 extra calories a year][bbc]
(which is about 8 lbs of fat), reduced back injuries, less back pain, quicker
reduction of blood glucose level after a meal, and less fatigue.

It's not all rainbows. As with anything, don't do it in excess.
[Standing up (or sitting down) for long periods isn't good for you][time].

### My first standing desk

These photos are of my first standing desk. Since then I've had better and worse
standing desks. I no longer use a standing desk, but I would if I easily could.

- [anti-fatigue mat](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B000EFK9KM) <sup>[[2]](#f2)</sup>
- [portable ergonomic laptop stand][cheap-stand] (not pictured)
- plastic bread-tag

The purchase of the laptop stand and mat came out to ~$60 total (~$30 each).

In between the adjustable laptop stand and the laptop I have a portable
ergonomic stand that raises the back of the laptop and gives me a slightly
better angle for typing. I picked it up at the dollar store.

My adjustable laptop stand came with an attached side-stand which I think is
meant for your mouse, but I use it for my phone. I superglued a plastic
bread-tag to it which keeps my phone's charging cord nearby when my phone's not
charging.

### Possibilities for better equipment

I have a pretty basic setup, it works great, but there's room for improvement.

1. Get a better anti-fatigue mat. I heard stacking them also helps.

1. Use a stool that's high enough to get work done while sitting.

1. Get an [adjustable desk][nextdesk]. They can be very expensive but they look
   great, are easy to adjust, and provide a good amount of desk space.

### My experience

I've used a standing desk for about a year. Overall I'm satisfied, but there
are drawbacks.

It sucks at first. You get tired very quickly and your feet hurt.
I don't have a stool at my home setup, so I stand for way too long which can be
painful. Take it slow, don't be stupid like me.

If you work from home, you may be tempted to go barefoot.
However, I find the extra support you get from shoes helps with the fatigue.

Take breaks, sit down, walk around, exercise, stretch.
I like to do [heel raises][heel-raise] while working.
Movement is key, whether you're standing or sitting;
make sure you're never still for too long.
I find it's easier to get moving since you're already standing.

You can still have bad posture while using a standing desk.
The keyboard and monitor should be at a good height.
[Your elbows should be at a 90 degree angle and you should be looking straight forward][height].
This is difficult to do when using a laptop, you tend to look downwards too much.

I feel I'm more productive when I use a standing desk. I can get too comfortable
and tired when sitting.

[1] Sitting by itself isn't really the problem, it's sitting poorly (e.g. too long, hunched, laid back, etc).

[2] You can also use a foam or yoga mat, which may be cheaper, but I don't know if they will be as effective.

[3] Posture tip: Keep your neck straight. If you need to look down, don't <a href="http://www.labour.gc.ca/eng/health_safety/pubs_hs/images/bending-neck-down.jpg">stick out your head and bend your neck</a>. Instead, try to keep your neck as straight as possible by tilting your head.
