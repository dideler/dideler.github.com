That's right, you can have Gmail line/word/text-wrap your outgoing emails
and it's easy to set up! Best of all, you can do it straight from the Gmail web
interface.

The biggest benefit of word-wrapping is readability. Giving each line of text
a length limit provides a consistent format regardless of screen size. This
limit varies by project or person, but let's agree that any limit is better than
no limit. Gmail will wrap your text at 70 characters.

To enable word-wrap, all you have to do is switch your outgoing emails to plain text.
The default setting is rich formatting (which is HTML formatting). To switch,
select *Plain Text* from the toolbar when writing your next email.
Gmail will remember your choice.
